Repo for all files pertaining to the PDP project.
Over the course of a year I worked with students at both Pace University and Aalto University to develop a home beerbrewing device for the Product Development course run by both university's "Design Factory" program. While working on the entire development process, my specific role was software developer, where I developed the interface to communicate with the microcomputer's various temperature/carbon dioxide sensors, controller the temperature regulator, as well as display all of this information on a small screen located on the device. This project was developed alongside Ericcson, our company sponsor.
